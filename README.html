<p>Hi, I&#39;m Kero. I make great websites.
I was born in Taiwan, but completed most of my education abroad, which makes me quite &quot;international&quot;. I enjoy reading, drawing, playing chess, and of course -- coding.
Currently I work as a front-end developer for a Taiwanese technology company whose main business focuses on marketing PC/App games.</p>
