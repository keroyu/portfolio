<p>Hi, I&#39;m Kero. I make great websites.
I was born in Taiwan, but completed most of my education abroad, which makes me quite like an &quot;international&quot; person. I enjoy reading, drawing, playing chess, and of course - coding. Currently I work as a front-end developer for a Taiwanese technology company that focuses on marketing PC/App games.</p>
