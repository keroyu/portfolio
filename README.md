### Kero Yu's Resume

Hi, I'm Kero. I make great websites.
I was born in Taiwan, but completed most of my education abroad, which makes me quite "international". I enjoy reading, drawing, playing chess, and of course -- coding.
Currently I work as a front-end developer for a Taiwanese technology company whose main business focuses on marketing PC/App games.
